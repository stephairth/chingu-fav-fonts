# Favourite Fonts ðŸš€

## Overview
This page was made for the Chingu Voyage 13 pre-work (tier 1). You can view the requirements for this project [here](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/voyage-prework-tier1-favfonts). 

## Features
This is a simple google fonts clone with limited functionality. 
* Text typed into the "type something" box immediately changes the sample text displayed the font cards
* The sample text returns to the default sample if the "type something" box no longer has any input
* The font size chooser immediately changes the sample text font size in the font cards
* The reset icon makes the page appear as if the user reloaded the page (but does not actually reload the page)

## Running the Project
**Live version:** https://stephairth.github.io/chingu-fav-fonts/ 

**From the repo:** 
1. Download this project as a zip

## Dependencies

## To Do List
* Include a back-to-top button that allows users to scroll to the top once the top of the page is out of view
* Make the page fully responsive (small/large/portrait/landscape, etc.)
* Implement the light/dark mode toggle buttons
* Implement the change display icon so users can flip between a grid and list layout for the font cards
